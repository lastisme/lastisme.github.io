  content: >
    "Last is me" is a lottery where the winner is the last player buying a ticket!<br><br>
    <div class="image-container bordered">

    Every square in the home page is a lottery with a duration and a ticket price as the title <span class="tag alert">A</span>.
    When you <a href="#howbuy">buy a ticket</a> you become the last player <span class="tag alert">D</span>
    and the countdown <span class="tag alert">C</span> is resetted. When the countdown expire,
    meaning none bought a ticket during the lottery duration, you get the jackpot <span class="tag alert">B</span> !

  title: Are you running away with the jackpot?
  content: >
    We simply can't! Every lottery is a smart contract written on the <a href="http://ethereum.org">Ethereum</a> platform.
    Execution is granted by the network and the running program is <a href="http://etherscan.io/address/0xAf396dcE15cb9E834fF9187f34f589dB22C849a8#code">verifiable</a> and unchangeable.
    In the lottery detail page there is a link to a third party site to verify the deployed code does exactly what we explain in this page.

  title: How to buy a ticket?
  content: > #
    To buy a ticket you only need an Ether Wallet such as the ones listed in the <a href="#whicwallet">next</a> question.<br>
    Go in the lottery details by clicking on a square, then:
    <ul>
    <li>If you have a browser enabled or an eth client on you machine with rpc port open at 8545 and one of your account unlocked (<a href="#launchgeth">example</a>),
    you can buy a ticket by simply pressing a button, however this is not mandatory.</li>
    <li>If you don't have an eth client or if you feel more confortable not unlocking your account you can just copy and paste
    the contract address on your wallet with the ticket price as <a href="#extraether">amount</a> and send the transaction.</li>
    </ul>

  id: howcountdown
  title: How the countdown is calculated?
  content: > #
    The countdown is an approximation of the lottery expiration.
    This is because under the hood the lottery duration is measured in number of blocks in the ethereum blockchain.
    This blocks are expected to be discovered with an average time but they can occur with variance.
    For example even if the average time between blocks is 14 seconds in the last 1000 blocks, the next block can be found in the next second or in a couple minutes.
    The countdown is therefore calculated as the remaining blocks to lottery expiration multplicated by the average block time.
    The greater the number of remaining blocks, the more accurate is the approximation, viceversa the approximation could be misleading cause the mentioned variance.
    Consider variance as a matter of luck :)

  id: whyblocknumber
  title: Why using number of blocks instead of block timestamp as duration?
  content: > #
    The block timestamp could be <a href="http://ethereum.stackexchange.com/questions/413/can-a-contract-safely-rely-on-block-timestamp">manipulated</a> by miners, to avoid this possible manipulation we decided to refer to the number of blocks.

  id: stilldidntreceive
  title: I won but I didn't receive anything!
  content: > #
    Since the winner is found only when the lottery duration is expired,
    the jackpot is sent only when the first player of the new cycle buy a ticket.
    If you are the winner and you are in hurry you can buy the ticket yourself.

-
  id: extraether
  title: I accidentally send more ether than required to buy a ticket.
  content: > #
    Don't worry, the amount over the ticket price is sent back to you.

-
  id: referral
  title: Do you have any referral program?
  content: > #
    Sure we have! Just share the link with <i>?r=&lt;your address&gt;</i> such as <i>http://lastis.me/?r=0xCA9dC3F33d0e1C3975300D1DcdF114B9e9c305e8</i> <br>
    The address is stored in the player's browser as a cookie.
    Then every time the player buy a ticket with a local client the house fee is shared 50% with the referrer.
    If the user pay the contract directly we can't share the fee with the referrer.
    You can also embed the lottery in your own site calling the <i>buyTicket</i> function of the contract with your own address,
    this way the site's owner get the referral fee for every bought ticket.

-
  id: whatsfooter
  title: What are the strings at the end of the page?
  content: > #
    They are the address of the server providing information for the lotteries.
    If you have a localhost provider running on port 8545, synced to the last block, it will be used.
    Otherwise it will be used an ethereum public node.
    The public node is used for your convenience but the best solution for privacy and speed is to use your own node.

-
  id: unavailable
  title: The site is unavailable for whatever reason such as ddos
  content: > #
    The site is fully functional when downloaded locally. We suggest you to download a local copy.
    We are also working to publish it on ipfs but we have a problem when javascript code call public ethereum nodes which are not https, so it's not working right now.

-
  id: gaslimit
  title: I am manually forging the transaction which is the reccomended gas limit?
  content: > #
    We reccomend to use 200k as gaslimit, however it usually requires much less.
    The first transaction starting a new cycle in the lottery is the more expensive, about 150k. Usually it requires around 50k.

-
  id: notupdating
  title: When I buy a ticket it takes a while to update
  content: > #
    The update of the lottery depends on how Ethereum miners find blocks. Usually they takes 14 seconds but it depends and it is not upon us.

-
  id: couldnotunlock
  title: Could not unlock signer account
  content: > #
    This message means that you are trying to buy the ticket automatically but you haven't unlocked one of your accounts.

    geth --rpc --rpcaddr="localhost" --rpcport="8545" --rpccorsdomain="http://lastis.me" --unlock=0
    </p>
    You can launch geth with one of your account unlocked to buy ticket just by pressing a button.
    If you are not confortable, unlocking the account is absolutely <strong>not mandatory</strong> and you can buy tickets by copy & pasting or qr-scanning the contract address from the lottery detail page to your wallet.
    Neither having a working client on localhost is mandatory, however it's reccomended because it's faster.

  id: exchangewallet
  title: Can I use a wallet provided by an Exchange?
  content: > #
    <strong>Absolutely not!</strong><br>
    Since we are using the sender address to pay back the jackpot in case of winning you have to be sure to be in control of the sender address!
    Use one of the wallet listed <a href="#whicwallet">here</a>.
-
  id: fees
  title: Fees
  content: > #
    The fee of the house is 1% actually. The first player restarting the lottery does not pay the house fee.
    The lottery owner could change the fee but no more than 2% will ever be possible as you can see from the contract code.
    All the rest amount, at least 98%, will partecipate to the jackpot, at least 90% to the same lottery,
    at most 8% could become jackpot of other "Last is me" lottery.
